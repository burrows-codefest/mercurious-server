    <h1>The History of Mercurious</h1>
    <b>Mercurious</b> - <i>liable to sudden unpredictable change; "erratic behavior"; "fickle weather"; "mercurial twists of temperament"; "a quicksilvercharacter, cool and willful at one moment, utterly fragile the next"</i>
    <br /><br />

    Mercurious was first forged on May 25, 2014 as the result of a skein of Front End developers wishing to learn more about the MEAN Stack (Mongo, Express, Angular and Node).
    <br /><br />

    The initial release was built to improve communication across the department, concatenating different feeds into one source of easily viewable information.
    <br /><br />

    Although created for good, Mercurious slowly turned into a bitter informal complaints system and a way to
    <a href="http://superherofrontenddevelopers.azurewebsites.net/#/memes/meme/53bd4c36065f87b42c000005">apologise when you released gases into the air at a slightly less than opportune time</a>.
    <br /><br />

    Planned future releases include a code review system and a reincarnation of the previously successful Bunomatic utility.
